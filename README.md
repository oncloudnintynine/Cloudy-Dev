# ☁️ Cloudy - Setup & Developer Guide

Cloudy is a serverless, Progressive Web App (PWA) built to manage company personnel, leave/event records, and Key Appointment Holder (KAH) constraints. It utilizes a static front-end hosted on GitHub Pages, communicating with a backend powered entirely by Google Apps Script (GAS) and Google Workspace APIs (Drive, Sheets, Contacts, Calendar, Gmail).

   participant FE as Frontend
   participant GAS as GAS Backend
   participant SP as Script Properties
   participant People as People API

   alt Admin Login
       User->>FE: Enter admin password
       FE->>GAS: POST {action:"login", password}
       GAS->>SP: Read adminPassword
       SP-->>GAS: "P@ssw0rd"
       GAS-->>FE: {role:"admin", name:"Administrator"}
       FE->>FE: Store in localStorage
       FE-->>User: Admin Dashboard

       User->>FE: Enter [phone][keyword]
       FE->>GAS: POST {action:"login", password}
       GAS->>GAS: Extract phone (remove keyword suffix)
       GAS->>People: Search contacts by phone number
       People-->>GAS: Contact + Contact Group memberships
       GAS-->>FE: {role:"user", name, phone, departments[]}
       FE->>FE: Store in localStorage
       FE-->>User: User Dashboard
   end
```

### Login Modes

- **Admin**: Default password `P@ssw0rd` (change immediately after setup). Grants full access to settings, user management, and all data.
- **User**: Password is `[phone][keyword]` (e.g., `91234567peace`). The backend strips the keyword suffix, looks up the 8-digit phone in Google Contacts via People API, and returns the user's name and department(s).
- **Admin on Behalf**: Admin can search for any user via Fuse.js fuzzy search and submit leave/events on their behalf using the target user's identity.

### User Registration

New users register through the app: name, mobile, unit, birthday. The backend creates a Google Contact, adds it to the appropriate Contact Group, and invalidates the contacts cache. Once Google syncs (~1 minute), the user can log in with `[phone][keyword]`.

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Backend Setup (Google Apps Script)

1. **Create the Script Project:**
  * Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com/) and create a **New Project**.
  * Name it `Cloud Moves Backend`.
2. **Enable Google Workspace Services:**
  * On the left sidebar, click on **Services** (the `+` icon).
  * Find and add the **People API**.
3. **Import Backend Code:**
  * Create files matching the exact names in the `backend/` folder of the repository (`Code.gs`, `Auth.gs`, `Calendar.gs`, `Leaves.gs`, `Settings.gs`, `config.gs`).
  * *Note: GAS uses the `.gs` extension instead of `.js`.* Copy and paste the respective contents into each file.
  * Open the project settings (gear icon) and check **"Show 'appsscript.json' manifest file in editor"**. Overwrite the `appsscript.json` with the one from the repo.
4. **Initialize the Database:**
  * Open `Code.gs`.
  * Select the `INITIAL_SETUP` function from the dropdown in the top toolbar and click **Run**.
  * Google will prompt you to authorize the script. Click **Review Permissions**, choose your Google Account, click **Advanced**, and proceed to the script.
  * *This function will automatically create a new Google Sheet named `Company_Leaves_DB` in your Google Drive and set up all default configuration properties.*
5. **Deploy the Web App:**
  * Click the **Deploy** button (top right) -> **New deployment**.
  * Click the gear icon next to "Select type" and choose **Web app**.
  * **Description**: `Initial Deployment`
  * **Execute as**: `Me` *(Crucial: This ensures the app uses your account's Drive/Contacts)*.
  * **Who has access**: `Anyone` *(Crucial: Allows the frontend to communicate with it anonymously; the app handles its own auth)*.
  * Click **Deploy**.
  * **Copy the Web App URL** and the **Deployment ID**. Save these for later.

---

## 🖥️ Step 2: Frontend Setup

1. **Configure the API Endpoint:**
  * Open `backend/config.js` in your code editor.
  * Replace the `PROD_URL`, `DEV_URL`, and `EXP_URL` with the **Web App URLs** corresponding to their respective deployments.
  * Set `const ENV = 'Prod';` (or 'Dev' / 'Exp') appropriately for the environment you are configuring.
2. **Deploy the Frontend:**
  * Push your code to your GitHub repository.
  * Go to your repository settings -> **Pages**.
  * Set the source to deploy from the `main` branch (root directory).
  * Your app will now be accessible at `https://[your-username].github.io/[repo-name]/`.

---

## 🤖 Step 3: CI/CD Pipeline (Automated Backend Deployment)

To allow GitHub to push updates directly to Google Apps Script automatically, you must generate `clasp` (Google's CLI tool) credentials. You can do this entirely in your browser using **GitHub Codespaces** without needing to install anything locally.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
   DEV["Developer pushes<br/>to main branch"] --> FILTER{"backend/<br/>folder changed?"}
   FILTER -->|No| SKIP["Deployment skipped"]
   FILTER -->|Yes| ACTIONS["GitHub Actions<br/>workflows/deploy.yml"]
   ACTIONS --> CHECKOUT["Checkout repository"]
   CHECKOUT --> SETUP["Setup Node.js v24"]
   SETUP --> INSTALL["npm install -g @google/clasp"]
   INSTALL --> CONFIG["Write ~/.clasprc.json<br/>from Secrets.CLASP_CREDS"]
   CONFIG --> CLASPJSON["Write .clasp.json<br/>with Secrets.SCRIPT_ID"]
   CLASPJSON --> PUSH["clasp push --force<br/>(overwrites GAS code)"]
   PUSH --> DEPLOY["clasp deploy -i<br/>Secrets.DEPLOYMENT_ID"]
   DEPLOY --> LIVE["Web App URL updated<br/>(same URL, new version)"]
```

### Setup Instructions

1. **Generate Clasp Credentials via GitHub Codespaces:**
  * On your GitHub repository page, click the green **<> Code** button, switch to the **Codespaces** tab, and click **Create codespace on main**. A browser-based VS Code environment will open.
  * In the terminal at the bottom, run: `npm install -g @google/clasp`
  * Next, run: `clasp login --no-localhost`
  * The terminal will provide a long Google URL. Ctrl+Click (or Cmd+Click) to open it in a new tab.
  * Log in with the Google Account hosting your Apps Script backend and click **Allow**.
  * Copy the resulting URL, paste it back into your Codespace terminal, and hit **Enter**.
  * Run: `cat ~/.clasprc.json`
  * Copy the *entire* JSON output block shown in the terminal. You can now close and delete the Codespace.
2. **Retrieve Project IDs:**
  * **Script ID**: Found in your GAS Project Settings (gear icon) under "IDs".
  * **Deployment ID**: Found via GAS Deploy -> Manage deployments.
3. **Configure GitHub Secrets:**
  * Go to your GitHub Repository -> **Settings** -> **Secrets and variables** -> **Actions**.
  * Add the following Repository Secrets:
    * `CLASP_CREDS`: Paste the JSON copied from Step 1. (Ensure you capture exactly from the first `{` to the last `}`).
    * `SCRIPT_ID`: Paste your Script ID.
    * `DEPLOYMENT_ID`: Paste your Deployment ID.
4. **How it works:**
  Every time you push a change to the `backend/` folder on the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will trigger `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, pushing the code and updating the exact same Web App URL so your frontend never breaks.

### Cache Busting

Because the app is a PWA, browsers cache the Javascript files. When you push an update to the frontend:
- Go to `index.html` and increment the version numbers at the bottom (e.g., `?v=59` to `?v=60`).
- Update `sw.js` `CACHE_NAME` accordingly (e.g., `cloudy-v120` to `cloudy-v121`).

---

## ⚙️ Step 4: Initial App Configuration

1. **First Login:**
  * Open your frontend URL.
  * The default administrator password is `P@ssw0rd`.
  * Log in to access the App.
2. **Configure Admin Settings:**
  * Go to **Menu -> Admin Settings**.
  * **Admin Password**: Change it immediately.
  * **User Login Keyword**: Set the keyword users append to their phone number to log in (e.g., `peace`).
  * **Organisational Structure**: Build your unit hierarchy.
  * **Register Users**: Register your first batch of users. Google Contacts syncing takes ~1 minute to reflect.

   OK --> RESP["Return status to frontend"]
   KAHSTATUS --> RESP
   RESP --> REFRESH["Frontend fetches<br/>fresh getLeaves()"]
   REFRESH --> FINISH(["Agenda & calendar<br/>reconciled"])
```

### Submission Details

- **Form Types**: Generic, Others, Official Trip, Overseas Leave, Local Leave, or custom event types configured by admin.
- **Events** (type marked `isEvent`): location, datetime pickers, attendees, repeat options, InfoAll toggle.
- **Leaves**: date pickers, AM/PM half-day toggles, overseas fields, attendees.
- **Attendees**: Fuzzy search via Fuse.js over company directory.
- **Offline Support**: If the device is offline, submissions queue locally and sync when connectivity returns. A sync pill indicator shows red (offline with pending), blue (syncing), or green (up to date).

### Edit & Cancel Flow

- **Edit**: Updates the sheet row, deletes old GCal events, creates new ones, re-runs KAH recalculation.
- **Cancel**: Sets status to `Cancelled`, deletes all associated GCal events, re-runs KAH recalculation to heal any limit alerts.

### Two-Way Sync (GCal Reconciliation)

Every `getLeaves()` call checks non-cancelled records with active EventIDs. If all associated GCal events were deleted externally, the record is auto-cancelled. Singapore public holidays are also fetched from Google ICS calendars (cached 6 hours) and merged into the leave feed.

---

## 👥 Parade State System

The Parade State provides a real-time organizational view of who is IN CAMP, OUT (on leave/attending events), or PARTIAL (half-day) for any selected date/time.

### KAH (Key Appointment Holder) Limit Engine

The KAH system enforces a maximum percentage of key personnel who can be out-of-office simultaneously.

```
Configuration (in Admin Settings):
 - kahLimit: Percentage threshold (default 50%)
 - customKahGroups[]: Named groups with members[], applyLimit, hasCalendar
 - approvingAuthority: Email recipient for KAH alerts

Flow on every submit/edit/cancel:
 1. Scan all non-cancelled, non-past records
 2. For each KAH-relevant record (isKahRelevant flag on event type):
    a. Check each custom KAH group the user belongs to
    b. Count concurrent OOO personnel day-by-day
    c. Compare (maxConcurrent / totalMembers) * 100 against kahLimit
 3. If limit crossed -> status updated + email alert sent
```

---

## 🔗 External Booking Portal

Cloudy supports an external booking mode for guests or non-registered users to submit events without logging in.

### Setup

1. In **Admin Settings**, generate an external token (UUID).
2. Share the link `https://[your-app].github.io/[repo]/?ext=[UUID]` with external parties.
3. External users see a simplified form with only Generic event type, name, date, and attendee fields.

---

## 🌍 Environment Isolation (Cross-Account Setup)

To completely isolate your Development, Experimental, and Production environments, it is highly recommended to host their Google Apps Script backends on **entirely separate Google Accounts** to prevent data cross-contamination in Drive and Contacts.

### Migration Steps
1. Log into your **New Google Account** and create a new project at [script.google.com](https://script.google.com/).
2. Add the **People API** service to the script project.
3. Manually copy-paste the contents of `backend/Code.js` from your repository into the GAS editor and run the `INITIAL_SETUP()` function. Authorize the script.
4. Do an initial manual deployment: Click **Deploy -> New Deployment**, select **Web App**, execute as **Me**, with access to **Anyone**. 
5. Copy the new **Script ID**, **Deployment ID**, and **Web App URL**.
6. Generate new `CLASP_CREDS` using GitHub Codespaces. Ensure you run `clasp login --no-localhost` and log in with the **New** Google Account.
7. Update your GitHub Repository secrets (`SCRIPT_ID`, `DEPLOYMENT_ID`, `CLASP_CREDS`).
8. Update `backend/config.js` with the new Web App URL to route frontend traffic to the new isolated database.

## 🛠️ Long-Term Maintenance & Enhancement Guide

### 1. Modifying the Frontend (UI/UX)
* The frontend relies heavily on **TailwindCSS**. You can modify the UI by adding Tailwind classes directly into the HTML strings found in `frontend/js/ui/ui.js` and `frontend/js/features/*.js`.

### 2. Modifying the Backend (Google Apps Script)
* **Testing Locally**: The system utilizes 3 separate environments: `Exp`, `Dev`, and `Prod`. Toggle `ENV` inside `backend/config.js` to point to the respective GAS backend URL.
* **Database Schema Changes**: If you add new data fields to `Leaves.js`, ensure you update the `verifySchema` array in `Code.js` to automatically generate the new columns in the Google Sheet.

### 3. Syncing Contacts to Phones (The .vcf Method)
Cloudy avoids complex Google Cloud Platform OAuth workflows for pushing contacts. Instead, it relies on a secure, native **1-Click Download**.
* In the App Menu, users click **"Save Contacts"**.
* A `.vcf` file is instantly generated and downloaded.
* iOS / Android will natively interpret this file and prompt the user to seamlessly add/update the entire company directory into their phone's address book.

### 4. Fail-Safe Code Updater & Backups
* In **Admin Settings -> Code Backup**, you can trigger a 1-click backup of the latest GitHub repository code to a Google Doc in your Drive.
* If the automated CI/CD pipeline ever fails (e.g., expired Clasp credentials), you can utilize the backup Doc text with the [Fail-Safe Code Updater](https://oncloudnintynine.github.io/Fail-Safe-Code-Updater/) tool linked in the admin menu to manually patch the backend.

### 5. Handling Google Contact Sync Issues
Google Contacts is used as the master directory. If a user is not appearing correctly:
1. Ensure the user's phone number exists exactly as registered.
2. If units are renamed or corrupted in Google Contacts, use the **"Force Sync G-Contacts"** button located in the **Organisational Structure** admin tab to wipe the relevant Contact data and overwrite it completely with the App's state.
